<pre>
Unity version: 5.5.0
Leap plugin version: 3.0
Leap driver version: 2.3.1
Note: The Leap example is similar to the Hydra but has much simpler controls.
Potential: EOL. Hardware discontinued. The reverse problem vs. Hydra, can capture fine details but not fast movement. Requires a clicker hacked into a stylus.
